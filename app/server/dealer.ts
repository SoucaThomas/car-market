"use server";

// This is a server action that would handle the form submission
// In a real application, you would connect this to your database
export async function submitDealerApplication(data: any) {
  // Simulate a delay to show loading state
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1500));

  // Here you would typically:
  // 1. Validate the data again on the server
  // 2. Store it in your database
  // 3. Send notification emails
  // 4. Return success/error

  console.log("Dealer application submitted:", data);

  // For demo purposes, we'll just return success
